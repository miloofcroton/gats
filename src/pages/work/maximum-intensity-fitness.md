This was my second group project at Alchemy Code PDX. My team consisted of two other team members. Together, wrote component architecture using Vue. We used Postgres for our database and wrote a simple server using Express. This was one our of first full stack apps, particularly the first that we went this in-depth with. We practiced good processes, such as git usage and Agile team principles.
